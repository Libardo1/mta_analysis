**MTA Project**   

This project is an exploratory analysis of NYC's MTA (subway) turnstile data.  
A group of myself plus two others decided to look at whether some stations had higher weekend evening traffic than weeknight traffic, and to determine if we could pinpoint places with active nightlife with the turnstile data.  
This code is how we retreived the data from the MTA website, cleaned, and then processed it.  
Results can be found at my [blog](http://trishaandrews.com/MTA-Turnstiles/)
